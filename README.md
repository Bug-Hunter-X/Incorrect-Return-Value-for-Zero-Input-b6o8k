# Incorrect Return Value Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions: incorrect handling of edge cases. The `foo` function is intended to multiply two numbers, but it erroneously returns 0 if either input is 0. The correct behavior should be to return 1 in this case.  The solution demonstrates the correct implementation.
